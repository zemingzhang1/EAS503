class IteratorClass:
    # Complete this class! It takes in three inputs when initializing.
    # input#1 x -- is a sequence, either a list or a tuple. Raise a ValueError if it is not a list or a tuple
    # input#2 y -- is a sequence, either a list or a tuple. Raise a ValueError if it is not a list or a tuple
    # input#3 operator -- is a string that can either be 'add', 'sub', 'mul', 'div' -- If the specified operator
    # is not one of these, raise a ValueError.

    # Complete the class by writing functions that will turn it into an iterator class.
    # https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/methods/built-in/iter
    # The purpose of the class is to take two lists(x and y), apply the specified operator and return the output
    # as an iterator, meaning you can do "for ele in IteratorClass(x,y,'add')"
    # NOTE: For the / operator, round to two decimal places
    # Raise ValueError when the length is not the same for both inputs
    # Raise ValueError when the operator is not add, sub, mul, or div.

class ListV2:
    # Complete this class to fulfill the following requirement
    # 1) The class only takes one input argument which is a list or a tuple;
    #    Raise ValueError if the input is not a list or tuple
    # 2) The class overload loads +,-,*,/ and returns a ListV2 object as the result
    # 3) The class can handle +,-,*,/ for both list and int/float, meaning the thing to the right of the operator
    #    can be a sequence or a number;
    # 4) The class is an iterator
    # HINT: Study the assert statements in the test file to understand how this class is being used and reverse engineer it!
    # NOTE: For the / operator, round to two decimal places

    # student test averages. File has student_name, test1_score, test2_score,
    # test3_score, test4_score, test5_score. This function must use a lambda
    # function and use the min() function to find the student with the minimum
    # test average. The input to the min function should be
    # a list of lines. Ex. ['student1,33,34,35,36,45', 'student2,33,34,35,36,75']

    # grades using map and lambda. File has student_name, test1_score, test2_score,
    # test3_score, test4_score, test5_score. This function must use a lambda
    # function and map() function.
    # The input to the map function should be
    # a list of lines. Ex. ['student1,73,74,75,76,75', ...]. Output is a list of strings in the format
    # studentname: Letter Grade -- 'student1: C'
    # input filename
    # output: (lambda_func, list_of_studentname_and_lettergrade) -- example (lambda_func, ['student1: C', ...])
